Sorting Method 1: Selection Sort
This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element(ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
> Coder Talk
In terms of an array arr, the selection sort finds the smallest entry in the array and exchanges it with arr[0]. 
Then, ignoring arr[0], the sort finds the next smallest entry and swaps it with arr[1], and so on.
Notice that we are only using one array. We sort by making the data trade places with one another.

Sorting Method 2: Bubble Sort
This algorithm is known as the most simplest. The array is traversed from the first element to the last element.
The current element is compared to the next element. If the current element is greater than the next element, it is swapped.

Sorting Method 3: Merge Sort
This algorithm divides an array into halves, sorts the two halves, and then merges them into one sorted array.
This algorithm is mostly used recursively.
